                <p>This is an amazing small local chain found all over Southern California known to locals for its amazing take on Japanese ramen and cuisine! The flavors found here are absolutely amazing and keep locals forming lines as soon as it is schedule to open.
                    It is definitely a must try if you find yourself near one of their stores found throughout SoCal. But a heads up! It will be busy most days so plan ahead and give the location you are heading to a call just to see what the wait time will be. Just know
                    that the wait will be worth it!

                <img src="images/the-source-food-court.webp" alt="The source">
                <p>Here is a shopping plaza that we recommend if you are looking for a varity of korean/asian fusion to try. Located in Buena Park, just 15 minutes from Anaheim is a shopping plaza influenced by the local population of koreans living in the area. The source 
                    is a treasure trove of restruants and small shops that make it a fantastic visit! There is occasional festivals hosted here too and if you find yourself in the area it is worth taking the time to check out this plaza to explore the different avaliable foods
                    and pick up a souvenir or two from the local shops. The source also features a large parking structure built right into the plaza that makes it super convenient to park cause 
                    SoCal is known for its heavy traffic and congestion.

                <p>Okay fair warning! You can spend multiple days explore this area and still miss out on a bunch of great eats. Also some restruants are CASH ONLY! So come prepared and have a little extra just in case. Like most areas found in SoCal, Little Saigon, located in Orange County south of Anaheim is heavily influnced by the local population. If you are looking
                    for a taste of Vietnam without ever leaving the states, then this is the place to see. Some of SoCal's best pho restruants are located here and while we can't exactly recommend one restruant for its amazing must try pho due to how many there are in this one area alone.
                    We do recommend that you visit one chain vietnamese cuisine found here known as "Brodard Chateau". Its a little on the pricey end but known here locally to be the inventors of the famous "crunchy" spring roll that has since been imitated around the world. This delectable 
                    roll is a must try for anyone a fan of any variation of eggrolls or the like.

                <p>An amazing authentic mexican restraunt that we feel is another local gem is El Farolito Mexican Restruant. Located in Fullerton, just slightly northeast of Anaheim by 15 mintues. This amazing eatery is tucked into a small neighborhood with limited parking however, with such good food. We feel it is only right to 
                    mention it and its sister restraunt El Farolito Jr. This mexican restraunt has some of the best salsa around with food that doesn't lose out to its amazing flavors. But be warned, the salsa is on the spicier side.
                    All we can say is that this is definitely an eatery you don't wanna miss.
